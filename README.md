# SnakeMan
This project was created as an assignment for my school classes. It is a snake game clone made with c# and WinForms with a twist, different fruits give different buffs or debuffs.
At the time I had little to no idea about basic concepts of OOP, and because of this the quality of code itself is poor, but It is in my opinion still a cool piece of a program,
and it was definitely very fun to develop.
